## Who are you?
As a Cringed Coder I'm a programmer. Everyday job writing js, css and html files
in not so big and not so small company in the center of Europe.

## But who are you personally?!
A dad of a lovely daughter, husband and still a programmer. Oh and I play games.
Not triple A's. I prefer indie games or classics like Quake III.

## Oh gee, that's so generic!
I like generic :)
